This is a repository of questions & answers related to BuckleScript (but don't really belong in the BS docs) and BuckleTypes. As people ask more questions we'll group the frequently asked ones here. **Please submit yours by filing an issue**!

### What's BuckleScript's async story?
First off, if you're not interfacing with any library that uses promises, you can simply use callbacks. It'll be the simplest and most performant way to have async behavior. If you need to bind to a JS library that uses promises, you can use BS's [bindings to promises](https://github.com/bloomberg/bucklescript-addons/tree/master/bindings/bs-promise). There's also potential to have some syntactic sugar in the future. In the long run, we'd like to implement a spec-compliant promises implementation in OCaml/Reason proper, so that the compiler optimizations could kick in.
On the native OCaml side, we have [lwt](http://ocsigen.org/lwt/) and [Async](https://ocaml.janestreet.com/ocaml-core/111.03.00/doc/async/#Std). We don't use them in web right now.
